                <p>Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. You can do it. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You have to make these big decisions.</p>
          
          <p>We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>
          
          <p>Do an almighty painting with us. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.</p>
          
          <p>Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Every day I learn.</p>

It should put happiness in your heart. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through....

                    I really want to emphasize that all spiritual paths are sacred. We are all different, and we are all journeying towards different things in life. While ultimately we are all one, there is an importance in honoring our unique divine intelligence within us and how it moves us individually. To that end, this section is aimed to help you listen to your intuition/inner knowing as you build your spiritual practice.
                    <br><br>
                    A regular spiritual practice is key for most people to break out of unhealthy ego patterns and ignorance. In committing yourself to regular meditation and other spiritual practices, you can enrich your life and deal with adversity better.
