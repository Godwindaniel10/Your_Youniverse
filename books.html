                The Secret:
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              The Secret focuses on the law of attraction and teaches us how we can use it in our day to day lives.
              One takeaway from the book is that you can have virtually anything you focus your energy on.
              Therefore, be sure to focus on whatever you desire and not what you don’t want.

                The Celestine Prophecy:
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              If you can get over the fact that it is not well-written, you will appreciate the wealth of ideas in The Celestine Prophecy.
              Unlike, The Power of Now, it encourages you to look at yourself both in the present and the Future, while also offering insights on how to take a more positive and active approach.
              If you like spiritual books with a tad of fiction, then check out The Celestine Prophecy.

                The Power Of Now:
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              This book has sold millions of copies, I think mainly after appearing on the Oprah Show. Eckhart made a major breakthrough in his life when he realised he was not his thoughts, saving him from suicide. He’s gone on to be one of the most popular spiritual teachers in modern times.

                The Alchemist:

              <br><br>
              The Alchemist is more than a book and has taken on a life of its own, inspiring movements across the globe.
              Santiago’s Journey, as he pursues his legend, is one most of us can relate to, and the book shows how the universe conspires to help you achieve your dreams.
              It is well written with tons of spiritual lessons to absorb, no wonder it’s gained such a cult following.
              It is only when the student is ready that the master appears.

                The 7 Spiritual Laws Of Success:
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              Deepak Chopra is renowned for his ability to take Vedic teachings and present them to a western audience.
              The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success happens to be one of his best works and emphasizes the importance of success.
              The laws themselves aren’t groundbreaking but rather, familiar, but that is precisely what makes it appealing; the fact that they are easy to relate to.

                Sacred Woman:

              <br><br>
              Sacred Woman is based on affirmations and rituals stemming from ancient Egyptian temple teachings through a naturopathic lens. The guide aims to help readers "love and rejoice" in their careers, their surroundings, in diets and in health, and the relationships they've cultivated in the community (or will cultivate).

              One reviewer said the tome is for readers who are "looking for peace of mind or spiritual connection; looking to understand yourself more deeply; looking to become a better person; or looking to lead a more meaningful, impactful life.

                A New Earth:

              <br><br>
              Every Ego wants to be special. If it can’t be special by being superior to others, it’s especially happy with being miserable.” Eckhart Tolle.
              A New Earth is another of Tolle’s work but one that revolves around letting go of your ego. It gained popularity thanks in part to being recommended by Oprah, A New Earth is a must read if you wish to reduce your inner & outer conflict.

                The Untethered Soul:
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              Written by Michael A. Singer, The Untethered Soul gives a perfect example of how we are lost in a dreamlike state.
              It is one of the best books on spirituality, if you want to understand how your mind runs your life and what you can do to get out of that illusion and get to the seat of the soul; to consciousness.

                The Tao Te Ching:
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              The Tao Te Ching is a 4th Century  B.C. work by the founder of Taoism, Lao Tzu, and offers insights on duality, balance, compassion, etc; lessons that are still applicable today. As far as classics are concerned, it takes the cake.
              The book seeks harmony and will free you from the caustic effects of greed, desire, and judgmental thinking. The Tao Te Ching is both a quick read and a long study, you will gain much from both.

              <br><br>
              Meditation: it's not just a way to relax, or to deal with life's problems. Done correctly, it can be a way to radically encounter bliss and to begin - and sustain - real transformation in ourselves.

                Becoming Supernatural:

              <br><br>
              A guide that intersects science and spirituality, Joe Dispenza helps you unleash your inner potential to free yourself from the past and transcend into a more powerful future (one where ordinary people can do extraordinary things). Becoming Supernatural plays with space-time versus time-space realities, and other aspects related to balanced energy and mindfulness.

                Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              Rather than dwell on traditional religious practice, Burton's guide focuses on "a kaleidoscopic panoply of spiritual traditions, rituals and subcultures," with more emphasis on astrology, witchcraft, and other cult-like social groups of today’s age and generation that are less aligned with religious beliefs.

              Hermann Hesse’s 1981 Siddhartha should be required reading for the spiritually inclined: It follows the journey of a young Nepalese man named Siddhartha during the time of Buddha, and his quest to find spiritual enlightenment.
