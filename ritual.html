    <span>Rituals</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; are on this earth since the beginning of our culture. Every tribe or kingdom had its own practices and rituals, which had brought people clan-ship and the belief in higher powers. A ritual is personal act, which causes that one’s will reach his/her goal. But it is not just matter of one’s will. The ritual means that one trust the higher powers and is able to bring a sacrifice. Only real trust in oneself can bring desired result. Simple writing of problems on a paper, burning the paper and burying it in the garden can also be a powerful ritual. There is no god or bad ritual, no right or false method. The success depends on one’s self-trust and trust in life, God or love.
    <br><br>
    If a mage wants to realise some wish, first of all he would visualize, imagine it in all details. The magic springs from the knowledge that the powers of nature have impact on people, their feelings, thoughts and their body. This is the reason why is important right time for doing some kind of ritual. Strong will is also important, together with magic tools used during the ritual.
    <br><br>
    <strong>The success of ritual depends on mage’s personal level of evolution, not from ritual itself!</strong> A miracles or supernatural things don’t exist. This view comes from people who don’t understand happenings and things around them and who are not able to understand them.
    <br><br>
                   
There are many ways and possibilities how magic can help. Magic helps for example to find new job, to support the healing of body or mind, to reach useful and good wishes and dreams, to create a second change for your love. The magic is universal and neutral power, which basically works everywhere in the same way. There are three areas of magic, which are performed the most frequently: Love magic, Money & Success magic and Protective magic. In order to perform successful magic, one has to take into consideration analogies. So, before you start your ritual, make sure you are using proper things in proper time and call the proper deities.

<span>Free Spells that Work</span>
  <br><br>
  We are always looking for free spells that work. The internet is filled with spells and rituals for almost anything you could imagine wanting to do but, the challenge is determining how effective the spells actually are. Where did they come from? Were they ever used effectively?
  I’ve come across so many that are clearly more artful poetry than real methods to engage the natural and unseen kingdoms. Some are just regurgitated from old texts and are calling upon energy matrix’s that are no longer active or full of power and kinetic energy to actually serve a purpose.
  So, to help all and those who desire to align themselves with the wisdom of the Spiritual center I offer a set of rituals and spirit guides for your spiritual growth and transformation.
  There is a reason children learn how to spell early on in life. It fashions a mind and feeds into the larger social ritual that is enacted against it’s unknowing passive participants.
  As you learn to become the spiritual worker you remove yourself from this process and design your own reality based on your spells, incantations, rituals,mental magic, and all of the spiritual gifts granted to you by the divine.
  <br><br><br>
  A &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>spell</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; is typically something thats perfomed through the aide of incantation and sound vibration. Language sets the tone for our perceptual reality so, when you learn to fashion your language along with natural formulas you can even change the perceptual reality of the Gods!
Once this is done they align with your spell and fulfill that reality that they see.
