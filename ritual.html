    <span>Rituals</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; are on this earth since the beginning of our culture. Every tribe or kingdom had its own practices and rituals, which had brought people clan-ship and the belief in higher powers. A ritual is personal act, which causes that one’s will reach his/her goal. But it is not just matter of one’s will. The ritual means that one trust the higher powers and is able to bring a sacrifice. Only real trust in oneself can bring desired result. Simple writing of problems on a paper, burning the paper and burying it in the garden can also be a powerful ritual. There is no god or bad ritual, no right or false method. The success depends on one’s self-trust and trust in life, God or love.

    If a mage wants to realise some wish, first of all he would visualize, imagine it in all details. The magic springs from the knowledge that the powers of nature have impact on people, their feelings, thoughts and their body. This is the reason why is important right time for doing some kind of ritual. Strong will is also important, together with magic tools used during the ritual.
