    <span>Rituals</span> &nbsp;&nbsp; are on this earth since the beginning of our culture. Every tribe or kingdom had its own practices and rituals, which had brought people clan-ship and the belief in higher powers. A ritual is personal act, which causes that one’s will reach his/her goal. But it is not just matter of one’s will. The ritual means that one trust the higher powers and is able to bring a sacrifice. Only real trust in oneself can bring desired result. Simple writing of problems on a paper, burning the paper and burying it in the garden can also be a powerful ritual. There is no god or bad ritual, no right or false method. The success depends on one’s self-trust and trust in life, God or love.
    <br><br>
    If a mage wants to realise some wish, first of all he would visualize, imagine it in all details. The magic springs from the knowledge that the powers of nature have impact on people, their feelings, thoughts and their body. This is the reason why is important right time for doing some kind of ritual. Strong will is also important, together with magic tools used during the ritual.
    <br><br>
    <strong>The success of ritual depends on mage’s personal level of evolution, not from ritual itself!</strong> A miracles or supernatural things don’t exist. This view comes from people who don’t understand happenings and things around them and who are not able to understand them.
    <br><br>
                   
There are many ways and possibilities how magic can help. Magic helps for example to find new job, to support the healing of body or mind, to reach useful and good wishes and dreams, to create a second change for your love. The magic is universal and neutral power, which basically works everywhere in the same way. There are three areas of magic, which are performed the most frequently: Love magic, Money & Success magic and Protective magic. In order to perform successful magic, one has to take into consideration analogies. So, before you start your ritual, make sure you are using proper things in proper time and call the proper deities.

<span>Free Spells that Work</span>
  <br><br>
  We are always looking for free spells that work. The internet is filled with spells and rituals for almost anything you could imagine wanting to do but, the challenge is determining how effective the spells actually are. Where did they come from? Were they ever used effectively?
  I’ve come across so many that are clearly more artful poetry than real methods to engage the natural and unseen kingdoms. Some are just regurgitated from old texts and are calling upon energy matrix’s that are no longer active or full of power and kinetic energy to actually serve a purpose.
  So, to help all and those who desire to align themselves with the wisdom of the Spiritual center I offer a set of rituals and spirit guides for your spiritual growth and transformation.
  There is a reason children learn how to spell early on in life. It fashions a mind and feeds into the larger social ritual that is enacted against it’s unknowing passive participants.
  As you learn to become the spiritual worker you remove yourself from this process and design your own reality based on your spells, incantations, rituals,mental magic, and all of the spiritual gifts granted to you by the divine.
  <br><br><br>
  A &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>spell</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; is typically something thats perfomed through the aide of incantation and sound vibration. Language sets the tone for our perceptual reality so, when you learn to fashion your language along with natural formulas you can even change the perceptual reality of the Gods!
Once this is done they align with your spell and fulfill that reality that they see.

<span>18 Spells and Rituals for Attracting Love, Health, Money, and Prosperity</span>
 <br><br>
 The period of the Waxing Moon, that is, the period when the New Moon grows larger and eventually turns into the Full Moon, is the best time for working magical spells and rituals for increasing things, attracting and bringing positive change.
 <br><br>
 <img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/26/09/witch-magic.jpg?width=1200" width="700" height="400" alt="">
 <br><br>
 In the approximately 14 days of the Waxing Moon, spells and rituals for increasing positive things into your life will be especially effective. These spells are meant to be as easy as possible for the beginner spellcaster to work, but rest assured that they are just as effective as any advanced spell.
 <br><br>
 <strong>Here are 18 easy spells and rituals that you can use to attract and increase health, love, money, success, new friendships, and luck.</strong>
 <br><br>
 <span class="h1">1. Positive affirmations</span><br>
 Positive affirmations work. Positive affirmations in the time of the Waxing Moon work more effectively. Here are some daily affirmations you can use every morning;
 <br><br>
 <strong>For increasing love:</strong><br>
 I attract love and joy into my life. I am a loving and wonderful person who deserves a loving and wonderful person in my life.
 <br><br>
 <strong> For increasing money:</strong><br>
I attract money. Money loves me and comes to me easily and in abundance.
<br><br>
<strong>For increasing success:</strong><br>
I am inspired, passionate, and powerful. I deserve success and attract it with every decision I make.
<br><br>
<strong>For increasing health:</strong><br>
I am completely healthy in body, mind, and spirit. I bless my body daily with nutritious food and healthy exercise. My mind is calm and peaceful and my spirit is happy and joyful.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">2. Candle magic</span><br>
Candle magic is simple and easy to do. You can also use candle magic along with your positive affirmations above. Take some time for yourself any evening during the Waxing Moon, dim the lights and sit in front of your lighted candle for 10 to 15 minutes. Visualize the thing you are attracting into your life, see it clearly in your mind, meditate upon it and know that what you desire will be yours soon. You can also repeat the positive affirmations during your ritual. Be careful that there are no flammable objects nearby, use your own discretion when working with fire.

<br><br>
If you feel that negativity is surrounding you, or a person or spirit has bad intentions towards you, there are many protection spells that you can perform easily in the privacy of your home. You don't have to be a follower of Wiccan, or Santeria to do these spells. Even if you do not follow a recognized spiritual path, these highly effective protection spells will help protect you, your loved ones and your home from anyone or anything that is threatening harm
<br><br>
<span class="h2">A Simple Protection Spell</span><br>
<br>
This simple spell comes from Jenna from The White Witch Parlour and is perfect for frequent physical and spiritual protection. It’s really easy to do and really great for centering and focusing your mind while providing general protection for you.
<br><br>
<strong>What You'll Need:</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>White sage</li>
    <li>Star anise</li>
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    <li>Oil & burner / Cauldron</li>
    <li>Black salt</li>
    <li>Protection stones</li>
    <li>Black candle</li>
    <li>Mortar & pestle</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<span class="h1">STEP ONE: CAST A CIRCLE</span><br><br>
Some start off spellwork by casting a circle. If this is you, begin to cast your circle now. You may like to smudge your space and stones/crystals to clear the energies that are present. Use the black salt to create a circle in your working space and place your stones in each quarter of the salt circle.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">STEP TWO: PLACE BURNER/CAULDRON IN CIRCLE
</span>
<br><br>
You can use an oil burner with a tea light or an electric oil warmer whichever you prefer or have access to. Place your burner inside the salt circle and begin to warm your oil.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">STEP THREE: GRIND YOUR HERBS</span>
<br><br>
Add a few leaves of white sage and dried rosemary to your mortal and pestle and grind into a coarse mix. Attune yourself with the energies of these herbs as you smell and work with them.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">STEP FOUR: ADD YOUR HERBS</span>
<br><br>
Add your ground mixture of herbs to the oil and further take in their energies as you raise your own energy and apply deep intention to your spell of protection. Next, add the star anise in a manner that is meaningful to you.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">STEP FIVE: AN INCANTATION</span>
<br><br>
“I seek protection and sound my alarm
My body, mind, and spirit now safe from harm
My aura a shield to help me stay strong
I now block negativity in all that is wrong”
<br><br><br><br>
<span class="h1">Pagan and Wiccan Cleansing and Protection Spell </span><br>
Pagans believe in the power of protective magic. This spell is referenced and used in several methodologies, and while it probably originated with the pagans, it is now used mostly for banishing all evil spirits from your home. This spell is more easily performed when you have a few trusted people with you to help.
<br><br>
<strong>What You'll Need:</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>A bowl of water</li>
    <li>Sea salt</li>
    <li>A smudging bundle of sage</li>
    <li>1 blue candle</li>
    <li>Blessed oil (you can substitute rosemary oil)</li>
    <li>Container (bowl or bag) </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Starting at the front door and moving clockwise, smudge the perimeter of each room (be sure to get all corners and windows) in your home with the salt, the lit sage bundle, the candle flame and the water. In each room, use the oil to anoint all doors and windowsills; a smudge will do, or you may choose to use the oil to trace the shape of a symbol of your tradition such as a pentacle or a Saint Lucy eye charm.
<br><br>
You can say something simple like “May the goddess bless this home" or use a cleansing spell like:
<br><br>
“With the purifying power of water, 
<br><br>
with the clean breath of air, 
<br><br>
with the passionate heat of fire, 
<br><br>
with the grounding energy of earth, 
<br><br>
we cleanse this space.” 
<br><br>
After you’ve done the cleansing ritual, ask your guests to put their token in the bowl or bag you’ve chosen, and put it in a place of honor in your home.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">Old Magick – Fennel</span><br>
A key element used for centuries to provide protection is  fennel. This herb is actually a symbol of good, so burning it or wearing it will help keep black magic and other evil influences away. You can grow fennel in your own garden or buy it dried or as a fennel oil; either way, evil humans or spirits will recoil from it.
<br><br><br>
<span class="h1">Phoenix Protection Spell</span><br>
<br><br>
<strong>What You'll Need:</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>A bundle of feathers, either all white or in a variety of colors</li>
    <li>1 long, slender candle</li>
    <li>1 pot</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Put the feathers in the pot, light the candle and use it to burn the feathers. When they have become ash, place your hands over the pot and say, 
<br><br>
“Oh mighty fire bird come bless this ash. 
<br><br>
Come through the planes, 
<br><br>
through beast gates smash, 
<br><br>
protect this place and all within. 
<br><br>
Let us hear the fire bird sing.” 
<br><br>
When you are through, smudge the ash on doorways and windows.
<br><br>
With these easy and proven spells and rituals, you can confidently shield you and your family from negativity and toxicity.
