        <h1>What is the basic purpose of religion?</h1>
        <p>
            Religion (particularly Christianity and Islam) are designed to focus the people's attention and energy on a single, unchanging, uncompromising and invisible supreme being who allegedly created an inferior human race just for some extra companionship and love for himself. Who then supposedly foisted a set of oppressive and in some cases arbitrary rules on them, which if broken would be met with unimaginable punishment.

            This keeps the followers in a continuing state of fear and compliance.  They are afraid to question the intentions of this invisible being and are even afraid to express their own individuality in many cases.  Christians and others are taught that they have virtually no power to do anything except pray, worship and do good deeds.  They are taught to practice self denial and are told that their own will is totally irrelevant.   Religious followers believe that they are yielding their will over to a benevolent cosmic individual who conjured up the universe in just under a week on a whim, when in fact they are handing their will and freedoms over to hidden groups of religious elites for the group's own agenda.
